\section{Decay Channels}

\begin{frame}{B Decay Modes}
    Key decay channels studied in Run~2:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $B^0 \to J/\psi(\to \mu^+\mu^-) K^0$
        \item $B^0 \to D^+(\to K^+\pi^-\pi^-)\mu^-\nu_\mu$
        \item $B^0_s \to \psi(2S)(\to \mu^+\mu^-)\phi$
    \end{itemize}
    
    Resonant structure:
    \[
        \Upsilon(1S) \to \mu^+\mu^- \quad (98\%)
    \]
    \[
        \Upsilon(2S) \to \pi^+\pi^-\Upsilon(1S) \quad (2\%)
    \]
\end{frame}

\section{Analysis Details}

\begin{frame}{Selection Requirements}
    Event selection criteria:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Track quality: $\chi^2/\text{d.o.f.} < 3$
        \item Momentum cuts: $p_{\text{T}} > 500\text{ MeV}$
        \item Isolation: $\Delta R > 0.4$
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    Total integrated luminosity:
    \[
        \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = 9\text{ fb}^{-1} \quad \text{at} \quad \sqrt{s} = 13\text{ TeV}
    \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cross Section Results}
    Measurement of $B^0$ production:
    \[
        \sigma(B^0) = (23.5 \pm 0.2_{\text{stat}} \pm 1.4_{\text{syst}} \pm 0.9_{\text{lumi}})\text{ }\mu\text{b}
    \]
    
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    Kinematic regions:
    \begin{align*}
        p_{\text{T}} &\in [0.5, 40]\text{ GeV} \\
        \eta &\in [2.0, 5.0]
    \end{align*}
\end{frame}

\section{Analysis Code}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Selection Code}
    Python implementation of the selection:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def select_B_candidates(events):
    """Apply B meson selection criteria."""
    mask = (events.track_chi2dof < 3.0) & \
           (events.pt > 0.5) & \
           (events.eta > 2.0) & \
           (events.eta < 5.0)
    return events[mask]
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Systematic Uncertainties}
    Breakdown of systematic uncertainties:

        \item PID calibration: $1.5\%$
        \item Fit model: $1.2\%$
        \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ determination: $2.0\%$
